ðŸ”´ Fail Test Cases
TC001 - Signup/Login: Accepts 12-digit Mobile Number (Fail)

Description: The Signup/Login page accepts mobile numbers with more than 10 digits (e.g., 12 digits), which is a clear violation of mobile number validation standards in India. It should restrict the user to only 10 numeric digits.

Impact: Users may register with invalid phone numbers, which could impact OTP verification and account management.

TC002 - Signup/Login: Accepts Alphabets in Mobile Number Field (Fail)

Description: The input field accepts alphabetic characters (e.g., "abcd1234"), which indicates a missing input type validation. Only numeric values should be allowed.

Impact: Invalid mobile numbers may be submitted, leading to failed verifications and a poor user experience.

TC003 - Signup/Login: Accepts More Than 20 Digits (Fail)

Description: The app does not limit the character length for the mobile number field. It accepts more than 20 digits, which is incorrect.

Impact: This can break form submissions, create database inconsistencies, and allow invalid registrations.

TC004 - Booking Page: Accepts 12-digit Mobile Number (Fail)

Description: Even on the booking page, the mobile number field allows users to input 12 digits. This inconsistency between modules reveals lack of shared validation logic.

Impact: Users may be unable to receive booking confirmations or updates if invalid numbers are entered.

Description: On the booking page, entering a valid 10-digit number allows the user to continue with the booking process smoothly.
